<h2>Angular</h2>

  Google doesn't support Angular project integration to old AngularJS. They "force" you to upgrade to the new version (
<a href="https://angular.io/guide/upgrade" target="_blank">more info</a>).
</div>

<div class="space">
  There are
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41303831/angular2-component-in-angular1-app" target="_blank">some ways</a> to do this but you will find some problems anyway:</div>
<ul class="circles">
  <li>No official support</li>
  <li>Definetely not the easiest and cleanest approach (specially on big projects)</li>
  <li>Problem to get new devs into a project like that</li>
  <li>Development time. Probably faster refactoring the actual code and doing a normal upgrade to Angular</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="mt-5">So what about if we can't upgrade?</h3>

<div class="space">
  It's understandble when we have a big project and we want to move everything to a newer technology face issues like this one.
  <br />
  Our approach here was create a totally separete new project (considering that we already had AngularJS working). Both of them running at the same time but linked each other.
<br />
If you check app.components out inside AngularJS project you will see that we are picking the style files up from the Angular one (this could be done in the other way around also).
<br />
On the same way we linked the menu options (app.component.html) to Angular. This would be replaced using some environment variables in order to use the real links when we compile the project.
</div>

<h3 class="mt-5">Other options</h3>
<ul class="circles space">
  <li>AngularJS + Angular: new pages and component using Angular. We could end up having the same component on 2 different languages if we need components (we can't have Angular inside AngularJS pages)</li>
  <li>AngularJS + React: new pages and component using React. We could also reuse new components on old pages</li>
  <li>AngularJS + Angular + React : new pages and component using Angular. For components needed on new and old pages we'd write them using React</li>
  <li>Angular: everything would be written using the new version. Obviously this would take more time but taking the first option (AngularJS + Angular) should be easier and faster
</ul>
